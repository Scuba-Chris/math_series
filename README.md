# math_series

**Author**: Chris Ceder
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
The problem domain of this program is to find the sequense in the Fibonacci Series and Lucas numbers with given a value within the series. The program then finds all of the values before the given value.

## Getting Started
To get started the user has to create two functions Fibonacci and Lucas. The each function has a if statement to find first two numbers in the series. Then, a for loop that is used to find the previous, current, and next numbers in the series. 

## Architecture
This program is built using python 3.7.5 within a pipenv shell. We also built a file to test all of the functions in series.py. 

## API
No APIs were used in this program
